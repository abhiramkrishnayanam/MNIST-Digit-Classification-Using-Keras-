# Project Title:  
**MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification**

---

## Description:  
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images of handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to accurately predict the digit depicted in a given image. This project serves as a foundational exploration of computer vision and deep learning concepts.

## Dataset:  
The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in machine learning and contains:  
- **Training Set**: 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.  
- **Test Set**: 10,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.  
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels.  
- **Labels**: Corresponding digits (0–9) for each image.

## Objective:  
To create a supervised learning model capable of:  
1. Identifying the digit present in an image from the MNIST dataset.  
2. Achieving high accuracy in predictions on unseen test data.  

---

## Key Features:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing and reshaping the input data for model compatibility.  
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converting categorical labels into a binary matrix format for multi-class classification.  
- **Model Training**: Building and training a neural network for digit classification.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing model accuracy and visualizing predictions.

## Project Workflow:  
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure and distribution of the dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling pixel values, reshaping the input, and encoding labels.  
3. **Model Development**: Designing a neural network for classification using Keras and TensorFlow.  
4. **Model Training**: Training the network on the MNIST training set with appropriate hyperparameters.  
5. **Evaluation**: Testing the model on the test set and analyzing performance metrics like accuracy.  
6. **Visualization**: Plotting sample predictions and evaluating model performance visually.

## Results:  
- The trained model achieves a high classification accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.  
- Predictions are visually validated through sample output visualizations.
